# note-taker

Note-taker is a node/express application that uses the FS package to mimic writing and reading to a database. The application
saves, deletes, and reads notes from the db.json file located in the db folder by using fs.readFile and fs.writeFile to push and splice
new "note" objects into an array housed in our db.json file.
